  "content": "Barcelona missed their chance to go 15 points clear at the top of La Liga as they were held to a goalless draw against Girona at the Camp Nou. Barca struggled to create chances in the first half and when they did could not beat Paulo Gazzaniga, who denied Raphinha and then Ronald Araujo in quick succession, the second save made when only a fraction of the ball had not crossed the line. Girona wasted a great chance to take the lead 10 minutes into the second half when Taty Castellanos was played through on goal, but he shot wide as Viktor Tsyhankov was crying out for a square ball. The hosts pushed for a winner in the closing stages but were repelled, with David Lopez making one last-ditch tackle to deny Robert Lewandowski and frustrating the Pole again when he made a goal-saving clearance. Gazzaniga made another good save in stoppage time after Gavi lost his marker, before Lewandowski was denied again. A point takes Barcelona 13 clear of Real Madrid, while Catalan neighbours Girona stay 11th."
