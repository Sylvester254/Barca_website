  "content": "There are 12 games to go in La Liga 2022/23, and that is also how many points Barça lead Real Madrid by. That is not enough to start celebrating anything quite yet, but the fact is that no team has ever thrown away such a lead in the history of the competition. And Barça have no intention of being the first. In fact, 12 points was also the difference between the clubs in 2015/16 with just nine games to go. But four games later, Madrid had closed the gap to just one! Barça eventually took the title on the final day thanks to Luis Suárez's hat-trick against Granada. So you can never be too careful... With six games left at Spotify Camp Nou and six games on the road, plus what remains of the Copa del Rey, there is a lot to look forward to this next two months. April: Cup semis and Atlético. Barça's first game back after the break is away to to bottom-placed Elche. Then comes the second leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final against Real Madrid, in which Barça have already made brilliant headway by winning the first leg 1-0 at the Santiago Bernabéu. April continues with three games at Spotify Camp Nou. There's a local derby with Girona, on paper the toughest challenge left in La Liga against Atletico Madrid, and another tricky game against Real Betis. Both the away trips in late April will see Barça heading for the city of Madrid, to face Getafe and then Rayo Vallecano. May gets going with a home fixture against Osasuna, potentially a dress rehearsal for the Copa del Rey Final if the two teams can make good on their first led leads in the semis. Barça have away fixtures in May at the homes of Espanyol for the Barcelona derby, at Real Valladolid and the final game of the league season at Celta. There are also two more home fixtures in May, against Real Sociedad and Mallorca."
